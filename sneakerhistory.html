            In 2000 Vincent Carter was wearing the And1 Tai Chi
             when he won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest. The event 
             came seven years after the And1 brand was first 
             created and solidified the sneaker's spot in the 
             "hypothetical sneaker hall of fame," Engvall told Business Insider.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 2001 Reebok x Chanel Instapump Fury is a legendary shoe for any Reebok
             collector to own, Semmelhack wrote. The shoes were never released onto the
              market — they appeared on the Chanel runway — but the dull colorway and
               oversized Chanel logo on the heel still made a lasting impression on
                both sneakerheads and high-fashion appreciators.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2002 Adidas partnered with couture designer Yohji Yamamoto to create 
            the Adidas x Yohji Yamamoto YY Promodel 2G. Semmelhack said this shoe was
             iconic because it marked one of the first times an artist of this caliber
              collaborated with a sportswear brand. "In typical Yamamoto style he took
               a traditional form, the high-top, and put his inimitable stamp on it," she said.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2003 Nike and Supreme released possibly their most iconic collaboration 
            to date: the Dunk SB Hi Pro. Semmelhack wrote that there were only 1,000 pairs
             released in the colorway seen here and that they were only released in the US and Tokyo.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 2004 Nike Air Zoom Huarache 2K4 paid homage to "classic basketball design principles"
             while staying modern in a post-Foamposite market, Semmelhack wrote. She also said it
              aimed to strike a chord with consumers who were part of the then-emerging push for retros.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2005 designer Jeff Staple released his Nike Dunk SB Pigeon. Semmelhack wrote that Nike asked
             Staple to honor New York City, so naturally he found inspiration from the inescapable bird.
        </p>

            The 2006 Alife x Reebok Court Victory Pump Ball Out combined the ideas of the streetwear brand 
            with the form and function of the Reebok pump model. This sneaker was designed to resemble
             a tennis ball and was made using similar, fuzzy materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2007 the Cey Adams-designed Adidas Superstar dropped. Semmelhack wrote that it was part of a
             larger project honoring legendary boxer Mohammad Ali and his values. Adams focused on the value
              of confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 2008 New Balance 993 became "the quintessential 'dad shoe,'" Engvall told Business Insider.
             He said it was one of the first New Balance shoes to be made in the US and come in a variety 
             of widths.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2009 Kanye West, whose nickname is "the Louis Vuitton Don," released a line of collaboration 
            sneakers with the fashion house. The below shoe was aptly called the Don's. Semmelhack wrote that
             they were "the epitome of luxury" at the time, featuring "premium materials and 24K gold shoelace rings.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2010 basketball shoes hit a peak, according to Engvall. LeBron James had made the move to Miami
             and Nike was celebrating with a "South Beach" colorway of the LeBron 8 shoe. The bright 
             colors and scarce availability made this drop "the perfect storm of excitement."

            Semmelhack named the Concepts x New Balance 999 Hyannis a 2011 icon.
             Wang added that the shoe paid homage to Hyannis Port in Massachusetts, 
             as both Concepts and New Balance are New England-based brands. He said this
              was the first of many collaborations that would come from the duo
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2012 West released his second sneaker with Nike: the Air Yeezy 2.
             Engvall said this shoe was even more popular than the rapper's first Nike
              release, mainly thanks to his rising social presence, influence, and 
              relationship with Kim Kardashian. Engvall calls it "the most sought-after
               sneaker for the summer of 2012."
        </p>

        <p>
            2013 wasn't the first time Japanese retailer Atmos worked with Nike. 
            But the Air Max 1 they released that year was "one of the most memorable 
            Maxes to date," Wang told Business Insider. It combined a woodland camouflage
             print with snakeskin texture to create the "Animal Camo" style for the sneaker.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 2014 Adidas x Rick Owens Runner is Semmelhack's pick for that year's sneaker icon.
             Wang agreed, saying it was the perfect combination of both brands: an impeccably crafted,
              functional running shoe and a sleek, structural, artistic design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Semmelhack named the 2015 FENTY x Puma Creeper one of the most iconic sneakers of that year.
             Footwear News reported that the shoe — which was the first collaboration between the singer
              and athletic brand — was so hyped up that it sold out within three hours of dropping.

        <p>
            The 2016 Pharrell Williams x Adidas Originals NMD Human Race brand was iconic on many 
            levels, Wang told Business Insider. Not only were they comfortable and functional — 
            they combined the Boost tech with a sock-like upper — but they encouraged positivity
             through colorways and in-your-face wording.
        </p>
        <p>
            Farfetch wrote that the 2017 Zebra Yeezy Boost 350 V2 might be "the most quintessential
             Yeezy sneaker ever." A product of Kanye's move from Nike to Adidas, this sneaker is an 
             evolved play on the Ultraboost. Farfetch reports Stadium Goods — a sneaker resale hub 
             — calls this shoe and colorway "one of the best Yeezy Boost 350s to exist."
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2018 Travis Scott collaborated on an Air Jordan 4 sneaker under
             the name of his record label, Cactus Jack. A Houston native, he took
              color inspiration from the Houston Oilers football team — now the 
              Tennessee Titans — and added some personal flair, Wang said.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2019 Jordan Brand called on famed street artist Brian Donnelly, commonly known as KAWS, 
            to design a variation of the Air Jordan 4. The KAWS signature art and "XX" on the heels
             turned these classics into works of art themselves, Wang told Business Insider.
        </p>

            After 22 years Engvall said the Fila Disruptor 2 had finally "come into its own" in 2020.
             "From the feet of Fashion Week trendsetters in Tokyo, Paris, and Milan, to collaborations 
             with sneaker boutiques in New York City, Los Angeles, and more, the Disruptor 2 was the
              perfect combination of trendy, stylish, affordable, and easily available," he said.
